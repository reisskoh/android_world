AndroidWorld Dataset - Screenshots
================================================================================

This directory contains initial screenshots for AndroidWorld tasks.

File naming convention:
  - Each screenshot is named using the query ID from queries_dataset.json
  - Example: 'ContactsAddContact_0.png' corresponds to query with id='ContactsAddContact_0'

How to link screenshots to queries:
  1. Load queries_with_screenshots.json (or queries_dataset_with_screenshots.json)
  2. Each query has 'screenshot_png' and/or 'screenshot_npy' fields
  3. The values are filenames in this directory
